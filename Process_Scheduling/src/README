****************************************************************************

To Compile:
	Run "make all". As a result, two executables oss and up will be 
	created. "make clean" will remove archive and object files created 
	durning a normal compilation. "make realclean" will remove the same
	same files as make clean and additionally remove executables and
	the default output file cstest.

To Run:
	Simply type oss from a shell. 
	Some environments will require specifying the current working 
	directory when running by typing ./oss. By default, oss will
	spawn 19 user processes (up). 
	Default output will be written to a file named cstest.

Optional Arguments:
	Typing master -h from the command line will display all usage
	options and information about each. To summarize:
	no optional arguments - default operation
	ARG:	EFFECT:
	-r	Dispalys the README file
	-f str	Directs output to file (str) overriding default cstest
	-s n	Sets maximum number of child (slave) processes to n
	-h	Displays help/usage information

	Each of the three arguments that require additional arguments
	will warn the user if required arguments are missing

Output:
	The output written to cstest will provide details on each
	user process as well as total simulator stats at the end of
	the report.
